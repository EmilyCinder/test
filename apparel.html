      <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold mb-6">Rift Apparel: Encoded Clothing Prototype</h1>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">This was one of the first experiments exploring how encoded graphics could be used to create scannable fashion that merges branding, authentication, and interactivity.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2">Executive Summary</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">Rift is a clothing label developed to test encoded graphics on wearable garments. Each piece was designed with unique pattern variation and linked to digital data, turning clothing into collectible items. This project explored the entire pipeline from concept to production — including sourcing, prototyping, design, scanning, and branding — all in support of proving fashion can be secure, expressive, and tech-integrated.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">As an early prototype for Spot Vision’s scannable tech, this experiment required extensive testing across different apparel styles. We tested fabric materials, adjusted encoded patterns for fabric stretch, and ensured each item had a unique identity. The goal was to validate that encoded designs could survive manufacturing and become part of a branded fashion line.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2">Objectives</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Create a unique, scannable clothing line using encoded graphics.</li>
        <li>Design and prototype garments using scalable patterning and fabric-safe designs.</li>
        <li>Establish Rift as a brand with anti-counterfeit utility through encoding.</li>
        <li>Test user scanning behavior and validate collectibility potential.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2">Design & Development</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">The process began with sourcing blanks and garment types that would best support printed encoded designs. I iterated on pattern design through multiple software platforms and worked with different clothing mockups to explore scale and composition. The encoding patterns were strategically altered to fit sections like sleeves, hoods, and pant legs proportionately. </p>
      <p class="mb-6">I developed the branding for Rift — a name symbolizing disruption and digital experimentation — and created digital tags using Illustrator. Each garment had its own scannable asset embedded and linked to Spot Vision’s system. Photography was done in-house to catalog each prototype, and production notes were kept to assess scalability and future launch strategies.</p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-2">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="mb-6">This apparel experiment laid the foundation for future encoded fashion projects. It proved that scalable, digital-physical integrations could be done with accessible tools, and emphasized that wearable tech can be expressive, collectible, and secure against counterfeiting.</p>
